# SoC_CNNlytical_2022
This repo contains all the work that I had done in the summer of 2022 on project CNNlytical

This project was undertaken in the summer of 2022 after my 1st year here at IIT Bombay. This project had aimed to teach us what are Neural Nets, CNNs etc. We followed the video lecturs of Andrej Karpathy on YouTube, they were amazing.

We completed 4 assignments that routinely checked our progress and also tested us on the same.
